<h2 id="what">Who is a <mark>coalbiter</mark>?</h2>
<p>
  Anyone. <em>You.</em> The name coalbiter comes from Old Norse term <em lang="is">kolb√≠tur</em>. Coalbiters are unlikely heroes who spend most of their time sitting idly by a fire to keep warm. They sit so close that they could bite the coals if they wanted to.
</p>

<p>
  We are the Claremont Coalbiters. We aim to keep warm by dancing, story telling, and cooking together. Check out our <a href="/events">events</a>. Fires optional, though encouraged.
</p>

<h2 id="join">It's <mark>free</mark> to join.</h2>
<p>
  Do you like fun? Of course you do. Who doesn't like fun? There's no reason
  not to attend one of our upcoming <a href="/events">events</a>.
