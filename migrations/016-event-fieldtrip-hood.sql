  "<h2>About the Hood Museum of Art</h2>
  <p>
Join us our first Field Trip at the Hood. The Hood Museum of Art houses the art collection of Dartmouth College. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>

  <p>The <a href=\"https://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/explore/collection\">collections of the museum</a> span multiple geographies, times, and styles. Here you can find treasures like ninth-century BCE Assyrian stone reliefs and the fresco mural cycle <a href=\"https://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/explore/collection/featured-collections/orozcos-epic\">The Epic of American Civilization</a> by Jos√© Clemente Orozco. There's a little bit for everyone here.
  </p>

  <p>We'll go on an hour-long guided tour that highlights several pieces of the collection. Then you're free to explore with other Coalbiters or on your own.</p>",
