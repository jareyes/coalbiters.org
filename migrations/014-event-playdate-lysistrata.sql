  "<h2>About Lysistrata</h2>
  <p>This time we're reading a classic by the Greek comedian Aristophanes. Written nearly 2,500 years ago, <i>Lysistrata</i> is about one woman who has had enough with the Peloponnesian war and decides its time to take matters in her own hands: she organizes the woman of Greece to go on a sex strike until the men stop their silly war.</p>

  <p>This is one of the first plays about organized labor, collective bargaining, and anti-war protests. But it's also full of sex jokes.</p>

  <p>You'll have fun. Promise.</p>",
